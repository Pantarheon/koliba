# KOLIBA

Sample applications to use the `libkoliba` library of parsimonious color
 correction/grading routines.

Until I get a chance to write a thorough explanation, the
[koliba.h](./src/koliba.h) file is filled with explanatory
comments.

To install `koliba`, please read [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) first.
